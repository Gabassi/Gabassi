- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gabassi - Enterprise Account Executive at Grafana Labs
- 👀 I’m interested in ways to develop my skills in observability and perpetually curious of how the cloud will influence the industry both technically and commercially. Outside of work I enjoy topics like fiscal policy, personal finance, golf, building basic Python applications, spearfishing, exploring remote locations of this world, gym.. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects on growth of anything SaaS
